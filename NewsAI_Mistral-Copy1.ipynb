       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Pune: Pune Cantonment assembly constituency was once known as a Congress stronghold until 2014 when BJP, riding on a Narendra Modi wave, dislodged it and managed to retain the seat five years later. This time, Congress is looking to wrest it from BJP and hoping to repeat its performance in the Lok Sabha poll held earlier this year. This was the only assembly segment among eight in the city where the grand old party had received more votes than BJP. Among the issues that affect citizens is the pathetic condition of roads. Those who take Pune-Solapur road just after Napier road and travel up to Dhobi Ghat near Golibar Maidan struggle to navigate potholes. What adds to their frustration is a 500-metre stretch that frequently sees traffic jams. Residents blame the lack of proper coordination between the Pune Cantonment Board and the public works department for the poor upkeep of roads. Tausif Shaikh, an auto driver, said, \"If materials like murum are used to fill potholes, the quality of roads takes a hit. They become accident-prone and dangerous as pebbles get scattered on the road, causing two-wheelers to skid.\" \"The vehicular movement is slow at the Cantonment Board junction. It is a very crucial patch in the eastern areas of the city. Special attention must be given to deal with this problem,\" Santosh Mahajan, a daily commuter, said.  The constituency houses many key defence establishments, including the defence estate office, southern command headquarters, and defence accounts, along with residences of senior defence officials. Poor water supply is another issue and residents point to Pune Cantonment Board\\'s poor coordination with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for this. The constituency, which is very close to peth areas, has many old wadas. Their redevelopment is stuck due to issues related to building permissions. Congress has named former minister of state Ramesh Bagwe as its candidate who will contest from this seat for the fourth time. Bagwe won the assembly poll in 2009, but lost to the BJP candidates in 2014 and 2019. A former leader of the house in PMC, Bagwe has also worked as president of Congress\\'s city unit. Eying a hat-trick, BJP has fielded sitting MLA Sunil Kamble again this time. A former PMC corporator, Kamble was first elected to the assembly in 2019. Since the 1960s, Pune Cantonment has had a sizable population of pro-Congress voters. Among party stalwarts who won from this constituency were Krishnarao Girme Shivajirao Dhere and Chandrakant Shivarkar.'),\n",

An office-bearer of NCP\\'s Ajit Pawar faction alleged that Kamble had slapped him too at the same venue. The slapping incidents unfolded during the inauguration by Ajit Pawar of a new building at the Sassoon hospital. Poll Do you support Gurdwara panel\\'s demand to rename Delhi\\'s IGI Airport to Guru Tegh Bahadur Airport?

The opposition parties have criticised the ruling grand alliance because of the occurrences. In one of the incidents, head of the medical cell of Ajit Pawar camp Jitendra Satav alleged that Kamble had slapped him before the event started.  He said, \"I was present at the venue where Kamble arrived. He started to use foul language against me. I could not understand the reason and tried to pacify him. I reminded him that we were from the same alliance. I tried to leave from there when he didn\\'t change his attitude, that was when he slapped me.\" Asked if he spoke to Ajit Pawar about the incident, Satav said, \"I could not, but I have narrated the incident to other senior leaders. They came out in my support and told me to stand against it. I will raise the issue. He misbehaved with me today, he could do the same with someone else tomorrow.\" Satav also submitted a complaint application against Kamble at the Bund Garden police station. Meanwhile, the BJP MLA\\'s video where he was seen slapping a person standing next to the podium went viral later in the day. The identity of the person slapped could not be ascertained. However, it was quite clear in the video that Ajit Pawar was on the stage when Kamble was going down and slapped the unidentified man. Kamble defended himself to TOI. He claimed he was roughed up by the other people and only retaliated. \"In the first incident (involving Satav), I was pushed by him multiple times. After my slap, the police also thrashed him. In the second incident, when I was coming down the stage, the man pushed me and held my collar. Thus, I slapped him.\" When deputy chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis - who was in Pimpri Chinchwad on Friday evening - was asked about the incident, he said, \"I was in Raigad for an event in the morning when I heard about it. I am yet to take a feedback of the incident.\"'),\n",

Bhosari\\'s BJP MLA Mahesh Landge is the only exception as his winning margin dropped by around 13,000 votes. Kothrud MLA and former BJP state unit president Chandrakant Patil was at the top as his winning votes jumped to 1.12 lakh in 2024 from 25,000 in 2019. Patil, after the announcement of the results, dedicated his win to the voters of Kothrud seat, saying that he will continue to work for the development of the constituency. The results came as a breather for four other MLAs who secured wins in the 2019 polls by thin margins of less than or around 5,000 votes. All these MLAs were \"relieved\" this time as they registered wins by margins of more than double the votes in 2019. Khadakwasla BJP MLA Bhimrao Tapkir\\'s winning margin jumped from 2,600 to 52,000. Shivajinagar MLA Siddharth Shirole and Pune Cantonment MLA Sunil Kamble recorded more than double their margins to 36,702 and 10,320, respectively, while NCP\\'s Hadapsar Chetan Tupe pushed his winning lead to 7,122 this time from the 2019 margin of 2,820.

This was also the lowest winning margin among the 11 seats in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.

Leaders of the MVA constituents - the Nationalist Congress Party, Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT) - in the city have already initiated talks in this regard and are determined to put up a strong fight against the BJP and the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena. Poll Do you support Gurdwara panel\\'s demand to rename Delhi\\'s IGI Airport to Guru Tegh Bahadur Airport? No Yes The BJP held a dominant position in the elected bodies of the two cantonments before they were dissolved following the lapse of their tenure in 2021. The Congress, which held a considerable sway over the two cantonments in the past, is eager to regain its hold with support from its MVA partners. \"The BJP has done little in terms of progress and development of the two cantonments. The cantonments have become bankrupt during their tenure because of wrong policy decisions taken by their elected members. We are holding a series of meetings with the MVA partners for finalising the names of candidates for contesting in eight wards each in Pune and Khakdi cantonments,\" NCP city unit president Prashant Jagtap told TOI. Jagtap said, \"The bypoll has boosted the morale of the MVA workers. We will work hard to ensure that our candidates are elected to prevent the BJP from wielding power in the cantonments.\" Congress city president Arvind Shinde said, \"The Congress still has a strong hold in the two cantonments.

The MVA is united and the Sena workers, who had earlier switched loyalties to the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, BJP and the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, are now extending support to the UBT group. In spite of having a BJP MP and an MLA, nothing has changed on ground. Local residents continue to suffer because of poor planning and lack of coordination between the BJP leaders.\" BJP city president Jagdish Mulik said, \"The MVA coming together to contest the cantonment elections does not make any difference to us because we have a good team of dedicated party workers. Nothing can prevent us from retaining power in the cantonments. The party has nominated cantonment MLA Sunil Kamble and Shivajinagar MLA Siddharth Shirole for monitoring and supervising the election work in the Pune and Khadki cantonments.\" The elections were earlier contested by independent candidates for decades. The system of contesting the elections on party symbols came into force later. In the 2015 election in Pune, the BJP won five seats, while two seats were bagged by the Congress and one by an independent. In Khadki, the Congress bagged five seats, two seats were won by independents and one by the BJP. In 2019, three Congressmen and one independent joined the BJP. The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB), which has 38,327 voters, received around 2,000 applications for inclusion of names in its voter list for the cantonment general elections. The PCB in its election programme has appealed to people, including first-time voters, to fill forms for inclusion of their names in the voter list between March 1 and 3. A PCB official said aspiring voters thronged the board office in large numbers and filed around 2,000 applications for inclusion of their names in the voter list.

At a two-day workshop held at Sewagram, the International Institute for Holistic Research and Voluntary Organisation (India -Germany) passed a resolution that the current reservation system must be substituted with a just system to support those below and around the poverty line irrespective of gender, caste, creed and community. A faction of orators from and outside the country advocated the Gandhian way of improving the living conditions of people. The other faction which comprised locals from different educational institutions and organisations showed solidarity towards the reform programs introduced by Dr Ambedkar. They introduced a newly-formed organisation - Ambedkar Students Forum. The orators included Nutan Malvi of Satyashodhak Samaj, assistant professor of Kumbhalkar Social Work College, Wardha, Arvind Chahande and Dr Sunil Kumar Suman, assistant professor of MGAHV, Wardha. They were of the view that Dr Ambedkar\\'s programs like the reservation policy were good for the inclusion of the weaker sections of the society into the main stream. The orators reiterated the slogan - Educate, Unite and Agitate. Many students took pledges to follow the enlightenment programs initiated by leaders like Mahatma Phule, Periyar, Birsa Munda and Dr Ambedkar.'),\n",

Addressing the BJP national executive last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had told his partymen not to lobby for their relatives for poll tickets.

Poll Do you support Gurdwara panel's demand to rename Delhi's IGI Airport to Guru Tegh Bahadur Airport? No Yes Shirole had demanded the assembly nomination for Siddharth in 2014 by opposing Kale.

The assembly polls are two-and-half years away, but sitting BJP MLAs and their opponents aspiring to enter the power corridors in the state have started preparations with these civic elections. All eight sitting BJP MLAs who gained from the ‘Modi wave’ in October 2014 assembly elections have played a role in finalizing candidates from their respective constituencies keeping away strong candidates from their own party. The emergence of any new leadership in the constituency would threaten their chances of a nomination in 2019 polls. Tickets to their supporters or relatives will ensure they will not compete with them for the assembly ticket. In Parvati assembly constituency MLA Madhuri Misal got her supporters and relatives the maximum tickets. No other BJP leader has emerged from this segment since Misal was first elected as MLA in 2009. Her sister-in-law Manasi is contesting the civic polls for the second consecutive term. Most nominations for the wards under Parvati assembly constituency were finalized after Misal’s consent. In Hadapsar assembly segment, first-time MLA Yogesh Tilekar has fielded his mother and former corporator Ranjana and his close aides, while in Wadgaon-Sheri, first-time MLA Jagdish Mulik has fielded his brother Yogesh and supporters and in Kothrud MLA Medha Kulkarni tried hard to keep away rivals within the party. In Kasba assembly constituency, guardian minister Girish Bapat was unwilling to nominate his party rival Ganesh Bidkar who aspires to replace Bapat in the future. Bidkar, who will be contesting the civic polls, blocked the entry of MNS leader Ravindra Dhangekar into the BJP as Dhangekar is a strong candidate for the Kasba assembly segment. He has since joined the Congress and is all set to lock horns with Bapat or Bidkar in the 2019 assembly polls. The Congress had no strong MLA candidate in Kasba segment, a traditional stronghold of the BJP. In Khadakwasla, MLA Bhimrao Tapkir got the maximum tickets for his family members and supporters. Pune Cantonment MLA and state minister Dilip Kamble’s brother Sunil is contesting while Kamble pushed hard to get nominations for his supporters in Parvati area with support from Misal. Former NCP MLA Bapu Pathare has fielded his wife, brother and other family members from Wadgaon-Sheri areas for civic polls. Pathare is trying to rebuild his base in the assembly constituency. Former Shiv Sena MLAs Mahadev Babar and Chandrakant Mokate have become active in civic polls to ensure the victory of their supporters in Hadapsar and Kothrud assembly constituency, respectively.

In Kasba Peth, it increased to 59.3% from 2019\\'s 51.6%, a rise of 7.64% and in Shivajinagar, the voting went up by 7.9% from 2019\\'s 43.9% to 51.7%. Sources from both parties said that the increased voting will favour their candidates. Pune Cantonment and Shivajinagar seats are with the BJP, while Kasba Peth is with the Congress. In the 2019 state poll, voting turnout in Pune Cantonment and Shivajinagar was below the halfway mark. Pune Cantonment was among the seats with the lowest turnout in the state. However, a noticeable increase in Wednesday\\'s polling helped the constituency shed this tag.  Congress leader Mohan Joshi said that the rise in voting in all three constituencies will go in favour of their candidates. \"The party came out with separate plans for every seat where it was going against the BJP. Increased voting in the seats where Congress is fighting is a hint that more votes have been polled in favour of our candidates,\" he said. Congress\\'s senior leader Ramesh Bagwe is contesting against the BJP\\'s sitting MLA Sunil Kamble in Pune Cantonment. Kamble defeated Bagwe by a narrow margin of 5,000 votes in 2019.

The Pune Cantonment primarily covers the defence and Cantonment areas in the city, besides the slum pockets like Tadiwala Road, Kashewadi, Bhavani Peth, and Somwar Peth. , which are part of the constituency. Local sources said that slum pockets have been voting in favour of Congress for many years. An increase in voting in these pockets is likely to benefit Bagwe.

There was overall enthusiasm among voters backing Congress,\" he said. In Shivajinagar, the BJP\\'s sitting MLA Siddharth Shirole is pitted against Congress\\'s Dattatray Bahirat. BJP functionaries claimed that sustained efforts were taken to push the voting up in Shirole\\'s favour. However, Congress workers said that Bahirat is likely to gain more votes against the backdrop of the rise in voting this time. Local sources from Shivajinagar said rebel candidate Manish Anand may dent Bahirat\\'s chances to some extent despite the constituency recording an increase in voting. In Kasba Peth, the Congress pitched sitting MLA Ravindra Dhangekar against BJP\\'s Hemant Rasne. The BJP\\'s city unit president Dheeraj Ghate said that the party will win back the seat. He claimed the bypoll result, which went in favour of Dhangekar, will not impact the outcome of this election.

None of the parties in the major alliances, including Congress and BJP, have yet declared their candidate for either constituency. Further, this time round, rumours that both these major parties may have some rebel breakaways here have also created a buzz among voters. The Cantonment seat, earlier known as a Congress bastion, witnessed the BJP win the last two assembly polls. Since the 1960s, the Pune Cantonment area has had a sizable population of pro-Congress voters. Party veteran Krishnarao Girme secured a win here in 1962; other Congress leaders like Shivajirao Dhere, Chandrakant Shivarkar, and Ramesh Bagwe followed in his footsteps.

Now, sources say that amid seat-sharing talks within Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), Congress is staking a claim on the Cantonment seat; over in the Mahayuti, BJP wishes to contest it as the sitting MLA is from this party. State unit chief of Congress Nana Patole also said on Friday, \"There is a chance that some changes may take place in the existing list of the candidates.

Earlier this week, Tapkir met senior BJP leader and deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis in Mumbai as well. However, the party is still mum. As far as the MVA goes, the NCP (SCP) is likely to stake claim to the Khadakwasla seat.

The elections in Wardha have generally been ruled by the Teli-Kunbi caste matrix, but in this election, parties are concentrating on other caste voters also. Wardha district, which has traditionally been a Congress bastion because of Mahatma Gandhi\\'s influence, has in recent years seen the rise of the BJP. However, in the last parliamentary election, BJP\\'s two-time MP and wrestler-turned-politician Ramdas Tadas lost to NCP (SP) Amar Kale, who was contesting the parliamentary election for the first time and had joined the NCP (SP) from the Congress just a few days before the election. To overcome the loss in the parliamentary election, the BJP is now targeting voters based on their castes like OBCs, SCs, and STs. Speaking to TOI, BJP office bearer Avinash Deo said that to overcome the parliamentary election defeat, they are carrying out house-to-house drives to connect with voters. \"We are targeting OBCs, SCs, and STs voters on a micro level. Apart from this, we are also raising awareness at booth level and informing citizens about several govt schemes, including Ladki Bahin as well as the free electricity scheme for voters,\" said Deo. Wardha district has four assembly constituencies — Wardha city, Arvi, Hinganghat, and Deoli. While Wardha, Arvi, and Hinganghat are currently held by the BJP, the Deoli constituency is held by five-time Congress MLA and former minister of state Ranjit Kamble.  Congress office bearer Manoj Chandurkar also claimed that their booth representatives and minority cell leaders are targeting caste-based voters. \"Primarily in Wardha, the Kunbi and Teli voters sway the elections. However, there are other caste-based voters such as SCs, STs, and Muslims, who also have a good voter base in the district, and we are targeting them as well,\" said Chandurkar. Meanwhile, several aspirants have also started campaigning for their names with their parties. \"The aspirants are carrying out outreach programmes as well as protests with the aim of showcasing their desire for party tickets,\" said political analysts, adding that everything would be clear after all the parties release their candidate lists. Currently, only the BJP has announced tickets for three seats -- Wardha, Deoli and Hinganghat -- in the district while Congress has announced Kamble from the Deoli seat. NCP (SP) office bearer Sunil Raut claimed that the Hinganghat seat is being allotted to NCP (SP) in MVA negotiations. \"We are banking on the Teli voter base to win the seat,\" said Raut. The Wardha district is all set to witness major fights as the BJP, which currently holds three seats in the district out of four, is facing anti-incumbency, which led to their loss in the parliamentary election.'),\n",

Some groups from the Brahmin community, which dominates the constituency, have also opposed Patil’s possible candidature. Mokate had contested the assembly elections from Kothrud in 2014 but lost to BJP’s Medha Kulkarni. Patil was, in fact, exploring three constituencies in Kolhapur district — Kolhapur north, Chandgad and Radhanagari — but all are currently with the Sena. The Sena is unwilling to give up any of these seats. Moreover, contesting from Kolhapur would mean farmers\\' leader Raju Shetti would stand against him. Shetti is not inclined to fight Patil in an urban constituency like Kothrud. Parshuram Seva Sangh, a Brahmin outfit in Pune, has opposed any move to field Patil from Kothrud, saying the constituency was one of the few which give representation to the community. “Current MLA Medha Kulkarni could get elected from Kothrud in 2014 due to the community’s support. Even during the recent Lok Sabha elections, the Kothrud assembly segment gave party candidate Girish Bapat a lead of around 1 lakh votes,” said Vishwajit Deshpande of the outfit. Anand Dave of the Brahman Mahasangh said, \"We will not be happy if the BJP fields a person who has not done justice to issues regarding our community, like the Dadoji Konddeo and Ram Ganesh Gadkari statues. Patil also had a role in displacing Brahmins from the Kolhapur temple. He also did not entertain our issues regarding the community.\"'),\n",

The BJP is yet to announce its candidate for Nashik East but former city unit president Balasaheb Sanap and over 30 corporators from the party in the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) have threatened to resign if he is not given the ticket. They gathered in front of Sanap’s residence and displayed banners in his support. Sena corporators from Nashik met at a city hotel and decided to field one of their leaders as an independent in Nashik West, from where the BJP has renominated sitting MLA Seema Hiray. “The Sena has got none of the three seats in Nashik city, which has completely demoralised the party rank-and-file.

Sena has renominated its Pimpri MLA Gautam Chabukswar from here. All BJP functionaries from Sillod in Aurangabad submitted their resignation to the party top brass on Tuesday after former MLA Abdul Sattar was given a ticket by the Sena. This could dent Sattar’s poll prospects to some extent. Contesting on a Congress ticket in the 2014 assembly elections, Sattar had won by a margin of over 13,900 against BJP candidate Suresh Bankar. Sena had a vote share of hardly 7.5% in that election. BJP fielded chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ personal assistant Abhimanyu Pawar from Ausa in Latur, a move that has upset both BJP and Sena workers there. Pawar is to take on Congress MLA Basavraj Patil. Earlier, the seat was being contested by the Sena, but the party seems to have exchanged it for the Latur rural constituency. Such was the opposition to Pawar that both Sena and BJP workers took to the streets in Ausa on Wednesday. They also gheraoed guardian minister Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar, demanding that the BJP-Sena field either Bajrang Jadhav, the BJP’s ZP agriculture committee chairman, or Sena leader Dinkar Mane in place of Pawar. Bajrang Sonwane, a prominent BJP face in the constituency, told TOI, “Pawar is an outsider. We want our parties to field a ‘bhumi putra’ (son of the soil) otherwise one of us is ready to contest.” Jadhav, who could be the rebel candidate, asserted that they had made it clear to the minister that they would not tolerate Pawar’s nomination. “He (Patil Nilangekar) told us that he would communicate our demand to the party leadership. One thing is certain: either me or some other leader could be a consensus candidate if our demand is considered,” he said. Manikrao Kokate, who was expelled from the BJP for contesting the Lok Sabha elections as a rebel earlier this year, joined the NCP on Wednesday and was announced as the party’s official candidate from Sinnar. He will fight against sitting Sena MLA Rajabhau Waje, who has been renominated. Kokate was a Congress MLA both in 2004 and 2009 but joined the BJP in 2014 and unsucessfully contested the Sinnar seat.

Poll Do you support Gurdwara panel's demand to rename Delhi's IGI Airport to Guru Tegh Bahadur Airport? No Yes It suffered major jolts in local body elections in July and November 2015 performing very poorly. Fadnavis campaigned extensively in the next round held in 2016 and 2017 and it fetched handsome results. Nevertheless, the scenario in the region is quite mixed. BJP’s performance as compared to 2014 assembly elections is down in some districts. The situation of Nagpur district is quite puzzling. Five out of six MLAs in rural parts of the district are from BJP. Congress won from Saoner because the BJP candidate had been disqualified before contesting.  However, in the municipal council elections held in November 2015, BJP lost all three. In November 2016, it improved its performance winning five out of nine councils. Interestingly, Congress lost two out of three municipal council elections in Saoner MLA Sunil Kedar’s constituency. Nagpur zilla parishad is presently ruled by BJP and Shiv Sena, and elections are expected to be announced very soon. In Wardha the case is reverse. BJP had won only two out of four assembly seats. However, it won all eight municipal councils and got a majority in zilla parishad. The position of Congress MLAs Amar Kale and Ranjit Kamble has weakened a lot. Gadchiroli has turned another BJP bastion. All three MLAs are from BJP. The two municipal councils are held by the party and it has emerged as the largest party in zilla parishad. In Bhandara all three MLAs belong to BJP but it lost the ZP elections held in July 2015. However, in November 2016, it won three out of four municipal councils. In neighbouring Gondia, BJP runs the ZP in alliance with Congress and rules both municipal councils and won Gondia municipal council giving a jolt to Congress MLA Gopaldas Agrawal. In Yavatmal district, BJP’s position has worsened. Even though six out of eight MLAs belong to BJP, it won only two out of seven municipal councils. Sena is the biggest party in ZP.

The bypoll to Prabhag 35(A) was necessitated following the death of newly elected BJP corporator Nilesh Kumbhare on April 10 this year. Barely a few days after a good show in the gram panchayat polls in many towns across the state, the Congress failed to increase its tally in the NMC House where its candidate Pankaj Thorat (5,248 votes) was edged out by BJP’s Sandip Gavai (5,711 votes). Poll Do you support Gurdwara panel's demand to rename Delhi's IGI Airport to Guru Tegh Bahadur Airport? No Yes “Gavai won the seat by 463 votes,” announced election officer Shirish Pande on Thursday.

Pande said 147 voters opted for NOTA. BY TABOOLA SPONSORED LINKS YOU MAY LIKE DBA Program for Working Executives upGrad Learn More Though eight candidates contested the bypoll, the main fight was between the BJP and Congress. Given the resentment among voters over price rise and hike in fuel prices, the BJP did not take the bypoll lightly. The party convened over 100 public meetings in the prabhag, which were addressed by district guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, mayor Nanda Jichkar, former mayor Pravin Datke, ruling party leader Sandip Joshi, Dayashankar Tiwari etc to retain the seat. The indifference in the Congress too was visible in this bypoll. Its two leaders — former MP Vilas Muttemwar and city president Vikas Thakre — spared only one day for canvasing, whereas leader of opposition in the NMC Tanaji Wanve did not even go to the voters for Thorat. Political experts pointed out that had the Congress managed to convince its rebel party worker Gautam Kamble to withdraw from the race, Thorat had a chance of victory. In the last election, Thorat, who was Congress candidate, had bagged 9,307 votes. But he was on the losing side as BJP’s Nilesh Kumbhare had won the seat with handsome margin. Gavai said that he would continue the development works in his new constituency. He, however, blamed the poor percentage of voting as the election was conducted on a working day. “Scattered booths were also a major factor for low voting percentage,” he claimed. Soon after the result was declared, Thorat demanded recounting of votes. The EO, however, refused his plea and said the result declared by him is final. To this, Thorat claimed that he would approach the State Election Commission and if necessary, move the court. Even Youth Congress activists led by wing’s city president and corporator Bunty Shelke demonstrated outside the counting venue in Sitabuldi area. Tally same for parties in 156-member House With today's results, the overall tally of the BJP has reached 108 excluding four co-opted members, while the Congress has 30 corporators including one co-opted member. BSP has 10 corporators, Nationalist Congress Party 1, Shiv Sena 2 and independent 1. Gavai’s career revived! Winning of bypoll has revived the political career of Sandip Gavai. He had won the NMC election in 2007, but in 2012 he was defeated by NCP’s Prakash Gajbhiye. Gavai, a builder by profession, had also contested MLC’s election from Bhandara-Gondia as well as MLA’s election from Umred but lost both. Defeat in three elections had actually halted his political career. Gavai, not a resident of ward 35-A, is considered close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari and had compelled the party to give him ticket, while rejecting the plea of deceased Kumbhare’s brother Ashish who too had shown interest in contesting the byelection.\"),\n",

The protesting farmers will also block the KMP (Western Peripheral) Expressway on March 6 as the anti-farm law protest at Delhi borders completes 100 days. The expressway will be blocked at various points for five hours from 11 am on March 6, SKM leader Yogendra Yadav said. He said SKM leaders will hold a public meeting in Kolkata on March 12 to appeal to the farmers of poll-bound states to punish the BJP. SKM leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said that SKM teams will visit poll-bound states, including West Bengal and Kerala, to appeal to farmers to defeat the BJP. \"We will not seek votes for any party. We will appeal to them to vote for those candidates who can defeat the BJP which has failed to address farmers\\' issues,\" Rajewal said at a joint press conference of the SKM at Singhu border. 2. A 28-year-old man was arrested for allegedly blocking actor Ajay Devgn\\'s car outside Film City in Goregaon and demanding to know why the latter had not spoken out in support of farmers protesting against the centre\\'s new agri-marketing laws, Mumbai police said. Rajdeep Singh, a resident of Santosh Nagar locality in the northern suburb, is a driver originally hailing from Punjab, one of the states from which a large number of farmers have gathered near Delhi for the protests, said an official. \"The incident took place around 10:30am. Singh stopped Devgn\\'s car and demanded to know why the actor had not spoken in support of the protesting farmers.

Opposition Samajwadi Party members staged a walkout from the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council over the farm laws and demanded that these be scrapped. They raised the issue of farmers\\' protest during zero hour and pressed for the immediate admission of their adjournment notice to discuss the issue. They also referred to the Uttar Pradesh Krishi Mandi Sanshodhan Adhiniyam, 2018 (Uttar Pradesh Agriculture Mandi Amendment Act, 2018) saying the law reduced the importance of \\'mandis\\' (wholesale grain markets). As agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi tried to defend the Centre\\'s laws and backed the measures of the Yogi Adityanath government for the welfare of farmers, SP members voiced dissatisfaction over his reply and staged a walkout. The House Council also passed the bill related to recovery of damages to public and private properties from protesters by voice vote. 4. The Akali Dal brought up in the Punjab Assembly the suicide of a debt-ridden farmer and his son and demanded the registration of a case against chief minister Amarinder Singh as his government had “failed” to waive farm loans. The two farmers had left a suicide note saying they were distressed over the new farm laws and also accused Punjab\\'s Congress government of failing to waive their loans. Raising the issue during zero hour, SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia demanded the registration of a case against Amarinder Singh, state Congress president Sunil Jakhar and cooperatives minister Sukhjinder Randhawa, claiming that they had “cheated” the two farmers. Majithia was referring to the Congress poll promise to waive farm loans in Punjab. Jagtar Singh (70) and his son Kirpal Singh (42) had allegedly consumed some poisonous substance at their home in Hoshiarpur\\'s Dasuya area on February 20. The MLA claimed that the two suicide victims had held the state government squarely responsible as their loan was not written off. 5. BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis trained guns at the Maharashtra government, suggesting it was trying to probe icons like Sachin Tendulkar and Lata Mangeshkar over their pro-India tweets issued after some foreign celebrities talked about farmers\\' protest near Delhi. Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh promptly refuted the charge in the state assembly, saying the state government has ordered a probe into tweets by the BJP\\'s IT cell and not by cricketer Tendulkar and legendary singer Mangeshkar. On February 8, Deshmukh said the state intelligence department will conduct a probe into allegations that some celebrities were pressurised recently to issue tweets in connection with the ongoing farmers\\' protest. Deshmukh had made the remarks on an online platform after the Congress, a ruling coalition partner in Maharashtra, sought an investigation into the BJP\\'s alleged connection with tweets of some celebrities and whether the saffron party \"arm-twisted\" them. A number of prominent personalities, including Tendulkar and Mangeshkar, had rallied around the central government on social media using hashtags #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda. This came after tweets by American pop star Rihanna and climate activist Greta Thunberg backing farmers who are protesting near Delhi\\'s border points against three farm laws. 6. The Delhi Police on Tuesday afternoon closed the Ghazipur border again, hours after it reopened a portion of NH-9 for traffic movement, officials said. The stretch was closed since January 26 when violence broke out during the farmers\\' tractor parade in the national capital on Republic Day. The one side of the road which goes towards Ghaziabad from Delhi was opened for traffic in the morning. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at the Delhi border points - Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur - demanding a repeal of the three farm laws. 7. Farmers in a Mathura village destroyed crops in a four-acre area to protest the contentious farm laws. The incident occurred at Umraya village of Chhata subdivision. \"With the consent of majority of villagers, crops grown in the four-acre area were ploughed,\" RLD state vice president Kunwar Narendra Singh said. He claimed that such acts by farmers would lead to acute shortage of cereals, forcing the government to go for import. \"Repeal the three farm laws without further delay to prevent such suicidal steps of the farmers,\" Singh demanded, \"We are forced to take such steps as the government is not understanding our problem,\" Megh Shyam, a farmer of the village, said. Sub-divisional magistrate Hanuman Maurya said no such incident had come to his notice, advising the farmers to desist from taking such steps. 8. A court in the capital granted a week\\'s time to the Delhi Police to file a reply to the anticipatory bail plea of Nikita Jacob, a co-accused along with Disha Ravi in connection with allegedly being involved in sharing a \"toolkit\" on social media related to the farmers\\' protest. Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana allowed the police plea to grant it time till March 9 after the public prosecutor said the agency needed time to file a detailed reply to Jacob\\'s plea. The court is scheduled to hear the anticipatory bail plea of another co-accused, Shantanu Muluk, on March 9. During the brief hearing held through video conferencing, senior advocate Rebecca John, appearing for Jacob, said she wanted to argue on her plea as a stand alone case and not with Muluk\\'s.

People believe that the suicide of Pandurang Thakare, a resident of Shirpur village in Deoli tehsil, was a direct fallout of MSEDCL’s adamant attitude in not providing connection to motor pumps to help farmers irrigate their lands. Poll Do you support Gurdwara panel's demand to rename Delhi's IGI Airport to Guru Tegh Bahadur Airport? No Yes Applications for 4,471 motor pump connections are pending with MSEDCL in Wardha district since 2012 despite the fact that ministers and district level officials were apprised of the situation time and again during review meetings. The situation is appalling in the wake of the fact that these farmers have completed all the formalities required to get power connections. Thakare, who was admitted to Mayo Hospital at Nagpur after he consumed poison, had claimed that he was taking the extreme step due to the dilly-dallying tactics of MSEDCL. But the charge was quickly denied by MSEDCL officials. Avinash Kakde, an activist, said that it is mandatory to provide power elections within 90 days of depositing demand money. But, he claimed, the power utility was not paying heed to their requirements. Many farmers have taken loans from banks and private moneylenders and have wells and motor pumps ready. But they are unable to use water for irrigation due to want of electricity. If crop yield is not good due to vagaries of nature, the farmers find it difficult to pay loan. The vicious cycle begins when they have to again take loan for fertilizers and such other items for the next crop. The farmers are fed up of this, but the district administration continues to be inactive, Kakde said. Kisan Adhikar Abhiyan (KAA), a farmers movement, wrote several times to the district administration about the plight while MLA Ranjit Kamble also took up the issue with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis during the review meeting held in April. The administration had assured the chief minister that electricity connections would be given by June. But this was not done. In August, the administration again assured the farmers in the presence of finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar during the review meeting that connections would be given by October. This too did not happen. In September meeting with power minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, the administration assured that the connections would be given by December. However, at a review meeting with the chief minister, guardian minister and all the four MLAs of the region held at Nagpur on Thursday, district collector Ashutosh Salil said that the connections could be given only by March next year.

District collector Ashutosh Salil said the tendering process was delayed six times for different reasons. However, he said that power connections would definitely be provided by March. Sudam Pawar, district president of KAA, said that farmers were constantly in touch with him, telling him that the situation was going from bad to worse as they could not irrigate land due to lack of power.

Out of 18,000 members, 700-800 members were present for the SGM. The meeting happened in the most transparent way,\" said Darekar.

Vivekanand Gupta, Advocate Secretary BJP Mumbai has called today\\'s bank decision illegal. Gupta said, \"Public money is being siphoned off by those very people who were its custodian. There is huge corruption in Mumbai Bank and thus I had filed FIR with EOW on 27 March 2015, investigation is in progress and i have been following the matter. The loan to sugar factories was illegal and outside the jurisdiction of Mumbai Bank.\" Mumbai Bank is the main financing agency of all affiliated co-operative societies in Mumbai district.

The bank claims that by passing this proposal, it will be cleansed of its non-performing assets (NPAs) and can begin with a clean slate. However, as the October 2015 the NABARD report has noted, writing off loans in the past has not decreased the bank\\'s bad debt. \"During the 2013-14, the principal amount written off for 35 societies amounted to Rs 158.09 lakh and Interest amount written off was Rs 1616.70 lakh.

Borrowing for house or house repair spiralled up dramatically - a the end of March 2013 it stood at Rs12,603 lakh and in two years, it had more than doubled to Rs 27275 lakh.

The opposition in the state is a house divided with BJP snapping the tie-up with Om Prakash Chautala\\'s INLD and BSP coming out of an alliance with Haryana Janhit Congress. Congress appears to be on a strong wicket in Arunachal Pradesh where Chief Minister Khandu Dorjee is among three party candidates elected unopposed. In Maharashtra, the NCP, a major partner of the Congress- led coalition, has been battling hard to retain its position after a poor showing in the Lok Sabha polls. The Shiv Sena-BJP combine has also been leaving no stone unturned to wrest power in the state. Maharashtra has a total of 7,56,34,525 eligible voters to elect 288 MLAs, while Haryana has 1,20,63,257 electors for choosing 90 legislators.

Chief Minister Ashok Chavan jumped the name-calling bandwagon dubbing Raj a \"frog\". Raj also mimicked the Congress President at a poll rally, to which Chavan said Raj should quit politics and join films. In this backdrop, glamour quotient was not to be left behind with several filmstars campaigning for the Congress-NCP candidates. Topping the list were Salman Khan, Shreyas Talpade, Sunil Shetty, Urmila Matondkar and Riteish Deshmukh. Riteish spent most of his time in Latur campaigning for elder brother Amit.

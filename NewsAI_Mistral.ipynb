       " Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Nand Gopal Gupta U P cabinet minister Nand Gopal Gupta (Nandi), who holds the key industrial development and investment portfolios, says systemic changes have been made to the land allotment process since the CAG report was tabled in the assembly in December 2021. Speaking to TOI’s Aditya Dev, he says the government is aware of homebuyers’ problems and will ensure their rights are protected Noida is UP’s main business city. Poll PM Modi will not complete his term, says Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut Disagree Agree But it’s still governed the way it was structured in the 70s through the Noida Authority with powers concentrated in a CEO. Noida’s population is growing rapidly but residents don't have elected representatives like councillors. Has the govt thought of changing the administrative structure or creating a municipality? The purpose of decentralisation of power is to provide convenience to citizens. It ensures that they don’t not need to visit Lucknow each time and problems are resolved in Noida. For this purpose, the Noida Authority has been mandated to be an autonomous body. However, there is no one above the state government, so officials should work with positive thoughts, and without any pressure and fear. The CEO should ensure that there is no misuse of power that comes with an autonomous body. I think the present system is alright and whatever steps are needed to improve it will be taken. Noida’s infrastructure is far better than many cities. For instance, if we compare Noida with Ghaziabad, you can see that there is a huge contrast between the two cities, be it façade lighting, cleanliness or wide roads. In cities where you have municipal corporations, quite often, they are found grappling for funds and managing staff salaries. Tabling the CAG report on Noida in the assembly was a big statement of intent from the government to clean things up after the Supreme Court's criticism of the Noida Authority as a corrupt body in the twin towers case. But we haven’t yet seen the reforms CAG suggested take shape. BY TABOOLA SPONSORED LINKS YOU MAY LIKE How can you generate additional income by investing with our AI signal system? Marketsall Learn More The government has taken the recommendations of CAG seriously. Decisions are being taken to ensure there are no financial irregularities. For the first time, action has been initiated against officials who have been sitting in the same office for decades. They have been removed. Stern action has been taken against officials found involved in racketeering, bribery and large-scale corruption. Officials who used to create problems through villagers have been identified and punished. The Noida Authority has undertaken several policy reforms related to land allotment. Earlier, when Rs 2 crore was deposited in Noida Authority, Rs 20 crore used to go to the political party that formed the government. What steps have been taken to establish a system of internal audit, a gap the CAG pointed out, to ensure compliance with rules and regulations within the Noida Authority? In response to objections raised by CAG, a firm has been appointed to conduct an internal audit of the Noida Authority. Additionally, internal audits have always been carried out by the Authority. Prior to CAG, the local fund audit department was conducting the internal audit of Noida Authority. There are lakhs of people who are either waiting for their houses in Noida or can’t get registries done because of the deadlock between the Noida Authority and developers over legacy debts. The government is seen to be aloof. Can we expect a resolution to this deadlock? The government is cognisant of homebuyers’ problems. They are not at fault at all. Builders flew with their hard-earned money or landed in jail after fraud was established. The government is actively working to ensure homebuyers get their rights. The chief minister has also expressed his concern. Homebuyers are our first priority. In group housing projects, partial OC has been introduced to facilitate the possession of flats. Sports City has many objections pertaining to its formulation and intent. Action against illegal farmhouses is being taken. Steps like reschedulement policy have lately been introduced. in Greater Noida, large-scale cancellation of non-viable projects has taken place so that competent developers may replace them. Noida faces acute problems with its power infrastructure, much of which is old and overloaded. In a city that brings in the big revenues, why’s an overhaul of the power transmission network not a priority? Noida has emerged as a hub for data centres. We have arranged to provide uninterrupted power supply to companies with dedicated supply lines. In the past, parties like SP, BSP and Congress robbed the state. But our government is working to bring back its glory and make it a self-reliant state in all manners. I am not saying that there is no scope for improving the power infrastructure, but things are in better shape. It will be improved further. CAG has also recommended that Noida Authority should review policies that have resulted in a preponderance of allotments to a handful of companies like Wave, Logix, 3C, Jaypee, and Amrapali who are also among the largest defaulters. What steps have been taken so far? As per recommendations and suggestions of CAG, the participation of defaulters with any department of Noida Authority in land allotment schemes published from FY 2022-23 has been restricted and provisions for the same have been incorporated in respective scheme brochures. Major amendments have been made in the allotment process specific to group housing schemes. The e-auction system has been implemented while the full premium of the plot has to be paid within 90 days of the allotment letter being issued. The sub-division of a plot (creation of third-party rights) is not permissible. Amalgamation of two group housing plots is not permissible. A maximum time limit of 13 years has been set to complete a project. Beyond this time period, no extension (free or paid) will be allowed. About a fourth of the MOUs signed at the Global Investors Summit this month are for proposed investments in the Noida (Gautam Budh Nagar) region. Is there enough land available in Noida? Noida Authority has an adequate land bank to allot plots to MoU signatories. In addition to purchasing land from farmers and removing encroachments from government land, a series of steps have been taken to reclaim unused land through cancellations. According to the Master Plan 2031, 65 acres of group housing, 198 acres of industrial, 365 acres of commercial, 130 acres of institutional and 35 acres of residential land is available for allotment in Noida. Additionally, New Noida (DNGIR) with an area of 215sq km is being developed. The areas under New Noida (DNGIR) have been notified and the Master Plan for it is in the final stage.\"),\n",

The drivers of public transport vehicles are infamous for abandoning their vehicles on busy thoroughfares once it\\'s time for them to take a meal break or to get off duty. Poll Do you think the Delhi govt has done enough to improve public healthcare facilities? No Yes They pay no heed to how their mammoth vehicles often obstruct moving traffic along key thoroughfares. In a first, a Pune court has convicted a PMPML driver for randomly parking his vehicle which led to a major traffic jam. In an order recently passed by Judicial Magistrate (First Class) N D Meshram, Asif Jilani Shaikh, 25, was found guilty under Section 283 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 190 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act (MVA). While the former deals with danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation, the latter is for violating standards prescribed in relation to road safety. Shaikh was driving a PMPML bus in the jurisdiction of Faraskhana police station on June 11, 2016. According to police, he had haphazardly parked his bus which had led to a massive jam in the congested area. Constable P M Dhakade from the police station filed an FIR against the driver for blocking traffic on the busy carriageway. BY TABOOLA SPONSORED LINKS YOU MAY LIKE H\\'ness CB350: Ride Your Way Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Book Now When the case came up for hearing in Pune\\'s JMFC, Shaikh pleaded guilty. The JMFC presiding over the case made him understand the ramifications of pleading guilty, which would tantamount to him being convicted. Shaikh, however, accepted his fault. Following this, Shaikh was convicted and sentenced to suffer simple imprisonment till the rising of court and to pay a fine of Rs 800. The case, many believe, will work as a deterrent for errant PMPML drivers who are known for such misdemeanors. Punekars continue to face instances of such behaviour on the part of PMPML drivers near Congress Bhavan, Vishrantwadi Road, Ganeshkhind Road, near YCM Hospital in Pimpri, Rahatani Chowk in Pimple Saudagar, and many such areas. When Mirror contacted deputy commissioner of police, in-charge of traffic, Ashok Morale, he explained that his office has taken up the issue of random parking and halting of PMPML buses on innumerable occasions with the authorities in the public transport body. He claims to have even drawn the attention of the transport body about drivers leaving their vehicles on the road after the end of their night shifts, which often lead to jams or accidents. \"The officials in PMPML are working on these issues. We have told PMPML officers to ensure that their drivers park inside their own compound and not cause nuisance to other motorists,\" he said. Sunil Gawali, general manager of PMPML, admitted that there is no excuse for drivers to park their vehicles in an indisciplined manner which cause nuisance to other motorists. \"Normally, there are two reasons for our buses being left on the road — one is breakdown, over which we have very little control, the other is drivers\\' highhandedness. We are not tolerant of the latter. I am not aware of this particular case, but will ensure that it acts as a deterrent to others.\" Speaking about this issue, Nuruddin Inamdar, general secretary of PMPML workers\\' union, affiliated to Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), said, \"Our men drive the buses in extreme conditions on city roads, the number of vehicles have gone up as well; on the other hand, there is no support from the PMPML administration.

On February 23, when voters of the constituency will exercise their franchise, 43-year-old Nand Gopal Gupta \"Nandi\" shall be looking forward to avenging the defeat of 2012 at the hands of sitting Samajwadi Party MLA Haji Parvez, to whom he had lost by a slender margin of less than 400 votes. Poll Should Team India have separate captains for Tests, ODIs, and T20Is? No Yes While Nandi is the BJP candidate this time, the BSP - which expelled him three years ago - has fielded Mashooq Khan as part of a strategy to give a substantial number of tickets to those belonging to minority community. The Congress, which Nandi had joined upon his expulsion from BSP and quit only last month, will end up supporting Parvez owing to its alliance with the Samajwadi Party.  Now Nandi\\'s electoral debut in 2007 had caused the BJP to lose its grip over the assembly segment which it had never lost since 1989. Nandi had defeated, by a margin of more than 14,000 votes, Keshri Nath Tripathi who was a five-time MLA, and had served thrice as the Uttar Pradesh assembly Speaker and was the BJP\\'s state unit president at that time. Emerging as the proverbial dark horse in an electoral contest that was being viewed as a \"clash of titans\", Nandi had humbled Tripathi and relegated Rita Bahuguna Joshi, then the Congress woman\\'s wing president and its future state unit chief, to the position of a distant third. Interestingly, Joshi, too, is contesting the current elections on a BJP ticket, from the Lucknow Cantt seat. The BJP could not recover from the upset it suffered in 2007 as Tripathi finished third in the electoral contest five years later. He has now moved out of the state on a gubernatorial assignment. The party, meanwhile, has high hopes from the ongoing elections which come against the backdrop of its stunning performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls when it won 71 out of 78 seats. Nandi, who was expelled from the BSP just ahead of the general elections, had contested the Allahabad Lok Sabha seat as a Congress candidate. His induction into the BJP last month, followed by a party ticket, has miffed many, most notably the Allahabad MP Shyama Charan Gupta. A businessman-turned-politician like Nandi, 72-year-old Gupta had unsuccessfully lobbied for party tickets for his son and wife. Incidentally, Gupta too had been with the Samajwadi Party until he joined the BJP just a few days before he was announced as the party candidate for Allahabad Lok Sabha seat. Known as an entrepreneur adept at marshalling resources, Nandi is said to have made a favourable impression on the party\\'s leadership last month when, while still with the Congress, he had organized a huge traders\\' conclave here in which businessmen with diverse political leanings - including Essel Group Chairman and Rajya Sabha MP Subhash Chandra - had taken part. His dynamism will be put to a bigger test in the electoral fight wherein he may be helped by the presence of two prominent Muslim candidates, but troubled by the pre-poll tie-up between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party which is likely to consolidate some communities in favour of the SP candidate.'),\n",

UP police first recognised his voice on September 13 when Pilot's telephonic conversation with an aide was tapped. Pilot was discussing the cash reward announced on him by UP and MP police. To dupe the police, Pilot would frequently change the SIM cards and locations. In fact, after the attack on Nandi, Pilot changed his locations more than 16 times and stayed at Kurla, Vile-Parle, Andheri, Santa-Cruz and Irrla.

Due to repeated adjournments, the Question Hour could not be taken. In the legislative council, main Opposition Samajwadi Party staged a walkout on the issue. As soon as the Vidhan Sabha met at 11 am, the entire Opposition was on its toes demanding vociferously immediate discussion over the law and order situation in the state, which they termed as the worst in the post-independence history of the state. Poll Do you think the Delhi govt has done enough to improve public healthcare facilities? No Yes Cutting across the party lines, the Opposition was united in its attack on the government, describing it as an utter failure, particularly on the law and order front. Tension ran high when most of the BJP members stood on their seats and the Samajwadi Party members rushed to the well, raising full-throated anti-government slogans. Ambika Chaudhary of SP, Om Prakash Singh of BJP and Pramod Tiwari of Congress sought immediate discussion on the matter by suspending all rules. Speaking on the occasion, Tiwari accused the government of shying away from debate on the law and order situation. The government, he said, had no courage to face the truth because it was unable to save its own minister, Nand Gopal Gupta Nandi, who suffered serious injuries during a bomb blast in Allahabad. He also tried to raise the issue of murder of Reoati Singh, wife of BJP leader Hukum Singh and demanded that her death should also be condoled by the House.  Now As the members even surged towards the podium, marshals of the Vidhan Sabha took position to avert any untoward incident, which fortunately was not the case on the occasion. However, the history of the House is full of such instances. When Speaker Sukhdev Rajbhar converted their notices into an adjournment notice and asked the members to speak on its admissibility, the members stalled the proceedings. As repeated pleas of the Speaker to restore calm went unheeded, he adjourned the House for half an hour. This was repeatedly extended. When the House met again, a verbal duel ensued between the Opposition members and parliamentary affairs minister Lalji Verma who said that the Samajwadi Party did not merit to raise the issue of law and order as the party had openly sheltered criminals during its regime. Quoting the report of the National Crime Bureau, the minister claimed that UP was the second best among 28 states and seven Union territories in its performance of law and order.

The agenda included tabling of the bill for anticipatory bail provision and the five private universities bills.

In view of the increasing attacks on politicians and their kin, the UP police have mooted a plan to constitute a dedicated force to provide security cover to MPs, MLAs, MLCs and other prominent politicians. The aim is to make these politicians residing in the state capital completely secure. Poll Do you think the Delhi govt has done enough to improve public healthcare facilities? No Yes A proposal to this effect has been sent to the state government for further perusal. The plan had been in the pipeline for the past six months. But it gained pace only after the recent attack on the politicians, including the bomb attack on a cabinet minister in the Mayawati government, said a source privy to the meeting for drafting the said proposal. It was on July 12 that a remote-controlled bomb attack targeting cabinet minister Nand Gopal Gupta `Nandi'was executed in Allahabad. Two persons including a senior journalist were killed while Nandi was seriously injured. He is still recuperating at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences.  Now If this was not enough, then Revati Singh, wife of Hukum Singh, a former minister and deputy leader of BJP legislative party, was found murdered at her Gandhi Colony residence in Muzaffarpur on July 31. The two recent incidents and many more in the recent past have provided the opposition parties the opportunity to slam the Mayawati government over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state. UP police plan to restrict the movement of people in and around the buildings having residences of MPs, MLAs, MLCs and other prominent politicians. Since there was no check on the movement of people in and around such buildings in the state capital, the plan also talks about restricting the movement of people inside the building if separate force proposal gets a green signal, said the source. As per the plan, regular frisking and checking of people moving suspiciously around such buildings would be done, provided the state government gives its nod to the force. The city has around six such campuses, having around 10 multi-storeyed structures, where personnel from the newly-proposed force could be deployed to provide the security cover, said a source. Citing an example, the source said that Darulshafa campus has four buildings where many legislators stay. But, there is no check on the movement of people inside the campus, the source added. Besides, the estate department, responsible for the maintenance of the buildings housing these politicians, would increase the height of wall of these these buildings. Besides, other amenities and facilities which could help in boosting security in these buildings would also be looked into by the department concerned. Since the police are already short of personnel, it has become difficult for them to provide adequate security cover to these politicians on the one hand and maintaining law and order in the city on the other hand.

Poll Do you think the Delhi govt has done enough to improve public healthcare facilities? No Yes Nandi, she said, had conveyed to Allahabad administration his suspicion that he was being targeted and that a `supari' for doing him in had already been paid. Despite this intimation the attack on the minister right in front of his house only goes to expose all tall claims of the CM extolling the improved law and order situation in UP. The CM, Joshi said, must accept the moral responsibility for the attack on his cabinet colleague, she must also ensure that the guilty are nabbed in time and the indifferent and incompetent district officials get befitting punishment for laxity which has nearly caused the minister's life.

Its coffers are full. I urge the chair to issue clear directions that petitions not only be accepted but also acted upon, with an action taken report sent to the chairman\\'s office,\" said Singh. He was seconded by independent MLC Raj Bahadur Singh Chandel, who added that most petitions remain unresolved. \"It is due to the lack of action on these matters that members have stopped filing petitions.

The matter has to be raised with the officers first,\" he said, addressing the chair. The MLCs argued that complicating the petition-filing rules is unjustified. \"While the govt promotes a single-window system on one hand, it entangles members of the upper house in complicated rules,\" said Devendra Pratap Singh.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Noida: After a delay of over 14 years, the industrial plot allotment policies of the three development authorities in Gautam Budh Nagar are likely to be unified soon. On Thursday, chief secretary Manoj Singh asked the Noida, Greater Noida, and Yamuna Expressway authorities to standardise their policies and present them before their respective boards for final approval. New Year Special Unbelievable! 2025\\'s most powerful zodiac predictions are here 50+ Happy New Year 2025 Wishes &amp; Quotes to share joy and cheer Numerology 1-9: What the numbers hold for us next year The revised policy involves plot allocation in two categories. Officials said plots up to 8,000sqm would be allocated through an auction, prioritising genuine entrepreneurs over investors. For plots exceeding 8,000sqm, allotments will be done based on interviews and objective criteria. Singh, who is also the UP industrial commissioner and chairperson of the Noida and Greater Noida Authorities\\' boards, emphasised the need for a clear, transparent policy for industrial plot allotment. BY TABOOLA SPONSORED LINKS YOU MAY LIKE She\\'s is Revealing Her Secret Strategy in Commodity Trading TradeWise Learn More It was in 2010 that the authorities made their first attempt at a unified land allotment policy. Greater Noida Authority engaged Sarc and Associates, a chartered accountancy firm, to develop a standardised framework. Although the work started in Oct 2010, logistical challenges hindered its completion. For more than a decade since then, the policy remained on the backburner. In Sept last year, Singh asked the three authorities to renew their contract with the CA firm for a unified policy. Each authority appointed a dedicated nodal officer — Soumya Srivastava (Greater Noida OSD), Sanjay Kumar Khatri (Noida Authority additional CEO), and Kapil Singh (Yamuna Expressway Authority additional CEO). A key meeting on Dec 12, 2023, brought together the nodal officers and finance controllers of all three authorities to evaluate the existing policies and develop new standard operating procedures. The Greater Noida Authority\\'s board subsequently approved the cost-sharing arrangements among the three authorities, and Sarc & Associates was officially commissioned the task of formulating a policy on Feb 29, 2024. The comprehensive policy document — Unification of Policies of Noida, G Noida & YEIDA — was presented to Singh this Oct. It focused on standardising various aspects of plot allocation, including eligibility criteria, lease terms, and rent structures. The unified framework aimed at reducing bureaucratic complexity, promoting transparency, and attracting investment. Officials said the need for a common policy was felt because changes in allotment criteria —alternating between objectives, interview-based selection, and e-tender formats — led to various complications. The situation reached a critical point when industrial land allotments had to be suspended following objections from industrial minister Nand Gopal Gupta Nandi regarding the shift from e-tendering to objective criteria without proper authorisation. The new policy, however, has faced criticism from industry representatives. PK Tiwari, former president of the Industrial Entrepreneurs Association, expressed concerns about its impact on small industries and MSMEs. \"This policy is not aimed at small industries and MSMEs, which are major employment generators,\" Tiwari said. \"A draw of lots would have provided fair opportunities. Instead, the policy appears to favour large, well-funded companies. We plan to address these concerns through a formal representation to the govt.\" Explore the yearly horoscope 2025 for Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces zodiac signs.

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='Lucknow: Not just the state, UP\\'s Multi-Modal Logistics Park (MMLP) Policy 2024 studied models from different countries of the world to draft its policy, which was promulgated by the state cabinet recently. It was notified by secretary Abhishek Prakash via a govt order on Wednesday. A multi-modal logistics park refers to a transportation hub that offers diverse modes of transportation and logistics services in a single strategic place. Designed to offer seamless connectivity, they provide streamlined movement of commodities and improve trade. The Indian govt is investing in the sector to accelerate economic growth vis-à-vis the five trillion-dollar economy goals. Such hubs would speed up transportation, which would cut costs and also help in reducing carbon emissions, on which additional emphasis has been given.

With the policy in place, decks have been cleared for the development of logistical infrastructure such as modern warehouses, cold storage, intermodal cargo containers, and cargo terminals, besides service systems such as customs clearance, storage yards, warehouse management, testing centres, packaging, grading, and labelling under one roof. As per the policy, projects with a minimum investment of ₹1,000 crore would be eligible to avail the benefits of the incentives rolled out. Those applying to set up a project under the policy should be registered as a Fortune Global 500 willing to make foreign direct investment of ₹100 crore in Uttar Pradesh. The policy provides for a 30% upfront land subsidy for the projects. The land subsidy would be given only on the land allocated by the state\\'s industrial development authority or any other govt institution. The applicant would also be exempted from all the development fees that would be borne by the respective development authorities. There would be a 100% exemption in the stamp duty on the land to be given on lease to the applicant. Various other facilities would also be provided.

The plan was initiated in 2010, aiming to streamline eligibility criteria, lease terms, rent structures, and procedural formalities across the authorities. Last month, talks resumed on the unification of policies at a board meeting of Greater Noida Authority chaired by chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh. A document — Unification of policies of Noida, G Noida & YEIDA — was presented to him. \"If adopted, the proposal promises to create a standardised regulatory framework for industrial land allocations and facilitate a more consistent and transparent process for businesses and investors,\" an official said. The need for a unified approach was felt a decade and a half ago as the three authorities struggled to maintain clear and consistent policies for industrial land allotments. Over the years, the allotment criteria changed multiple times — from that based on objectives to interviews and then e-tenders. Finally, they settled for objective-based criteria. BY TABOOLA SPONSORED LINKS YOU MAY LIKE This Incredible Rs.1999 Smartwatch Is Taking India By Storm Online Journal Learn More But this back and forth came at a cost — industrial land allotments remained suspended for almost 10 months. Industries minister Nand Gopal Gupta (Nandi) raised objections on the authorities\\' plan to adopt the objective criteria without a formal approval from the CM. It was in 2010 that Greater Noida Authority hired Sarc & Associates — a chartered accountancy firm — to draft a standardised approach involving land allotments. This was after officials raised concerns that varied policies were causing inconsistencies and causing operational inefficiencies and confusion among businesses and investors. A formal contract was executed with Sarc in Oct 2010. The agency initiated work, but could not complete the project because of logistical reasons. In Sept last year, Singh wrote to the authorities to renew the contract with Sarc for a uniform policy. Each Authority designated a nodal officer — Soumya Srivastava (Greater Noida), Sanjay Kumar Khatri (Noida) and Kapil Singh (Yamuna Expressway). Interestingly, Sarc agreed to resume work at the rate decided 14 years ago — Rs 36.5 lakh — plus GST. A meeting was convened in Dec last year among the nodal officers and finance controllers of all three authorities. The key agenda was to assess current policies, streamline procedures, and draft the new SOPs. The Greater Noida Authority\\'s board approved a proposal to share the consultancy cost with its counterparts. A letter dated Feb 29 this year commissioned Sarc to carry out the task. It included aligning the criteria for eligibility, lease terms, rent structures, and other procedural formalities to ensure a consistent regulatory framework for land allotments across the district. The unified policy proposal is now awaiting approval from the boards of all three authorities.'),\n",

Authorities plan to use e-auctions for plots up to 8,000sqm, and an objective criteria or interview for larger land parcels. The decision follows a review meeting led by chief minister Yogi Adityanath. According to sources, Noida, Greater Noida, and Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authorities, being autonomous bodies, had sought approval from the CM to determine the method and criteria for plot allotments independently. Poll Do you think the Delhi govt has done enough to improve public healthcare facilities? No Yes On July 6 last year, UP industrial development commissioner Manoj Kumar Singh issued a letter directing the authorities to abolish the e-auction process and reinstate the previous objective criteria method, effective before April 2022. Noida and Greater Noida authorities switched to an interview-based method after scrapping the e-auction process in Aug, and YEIDA followed suit in Sept. The move followed persistent agitation by entrepreneurs, particularly those in the micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) sector, who argued that the e-auction process favoured large-scale entrepreneurs, making it difficult for smaller enterprises to secure plots. Noida Authority subsequently allotted some plots to industrialists based on the new criteria, while Greater Noida and YEIDA launched schemes under the revised system.

This directive stalled the allotment process, which is now expected to resume soon with the issuance of a new order to implement the updated policy. Before April 2022, industrial plots in GB Nagar were allocated through a combination of draws, interviews, and evaluations by a screening committee led by the chief executive officer. Entrepreneurs of all categories were eligible to participate. Plots larger than 2,000 sqm were allocated after evaluation by the screening committee, and those smaller than 2,000 sqm were allocated through a draw of lots. PK Tiwari, president of the Industrial Entrepreneurs Association, expressed concern that the new categorisation still favours larger investors. \"The e-auction process inflates the prices of industrial plots, pushing small entrepreneurs out of the race. The authorities should consider allowing plot allotments up to 2,000 sqm through a draw of lots to ensure smaller industrialists can still access land. Otherwise, only bigger companies will be able to set up industries here, severely impacting the MSME sector, which is the largest job creator,\" Tiwari said.'),\n",

Since the party think tank is of the view that if the target of 75 seats is achieved in UP, BJP would be in a better position to cover up the possibly losses it might incur in other states, any of these candidates will make the final cut only when they fulfill the 'winnability' criterion.\"),\n",

His nameplate has already gone up at the entrance of the bungalow. “Humein bhagwan ka aashirwad prapt hai ( I am blessed by the divine),” he said to the questions around his move. Nandi said he had heard of the superstitions and that many powerful people had deserted the bungalow, but he was prepared. “I engaged some vastu experts and astrologers who said the bungalow was inauspicious due to defects in its architecture. I have taken remedial measures of installing a wind mill and performed a puja. Now, it is perfect and I am set to shift,” Nandi said. He added he had taken the decision despite owning a huge house in Gomtinagar. A few months ago, BJP minister Baghel had also shifted to the bungalow with the same confidence and spirit. However, soon after, he faced a PIL challenging his caste and election. It was then that he decided the bungalow was ominous, and shifted out. It is to be seen whether Nandi’s fate prospers or declines after shifting to bungalow number 6.\n",
